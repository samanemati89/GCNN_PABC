# GCNN - Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Post-Stroke Aphasia Classification

This repository contains code for a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** model designed to classify **patients with post-stroke aphasia** from **healthy controls** based on their **brain connectivity graphs**.

## üß† Project Overview
- **Graph Structure:**
  - **Nodes** = Brain regions (from DTI)
  - **Edges** = Structural connectivity strength
  - **Node Features** = Resting-state fMRI time-series

- **Models Implemented:**
  - **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)**
  - **Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)**
  - **Self-Attention Graph Pooling (SAGPool)**
